# GNB Classifier
Class for a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier (Python)

naive_bayes.py includes the code for a GNB classifier class.

test.py demonstrates how to use the class.\n
  --> x_train is array-like with NUMERIC data. Rows should be your data points and columns should be features.\n
  --> y_train should have the same number of rows as x_train and should be one column of labels.\n
  
  --> .predict() should take in data to make predictions on. Should be array-like with rows for data points, and the same number of columns as x_train.\n
  
accuracy.py explores the performance of this classifier.
